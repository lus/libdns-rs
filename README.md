# libdns-rs

This project is a rip-off of [libdns](https://github.com/libdns/libdns) written in Rust.
It defines an abstract API for managing DNS zones and implements it for several widely-used providers.

> [!NOTE]
> This project is my very first (serious) attempt at learning Rust. I am more than thankful for any suggestions and tips on this matter, so please feel welcomed to bring them up in an issue :)
